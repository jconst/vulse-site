					<h2>Attachment Guide</h2>
					<p>How to attach your phone to your instrument</p>
				</header>
				<p id="cases">To take full advantage of Vulse's interactive features, you'll need a way to temporarily affix your
					device to your instrument. If it's a guitar, bass, or another instrument (keytar, anyone?) with enough flat,
					smooth space to adhere your phone, then it's as simple as getting one of the micro-suction cases below.

					<h3>Micro-Suction Cases</h3>

					<p>All micro-suction cases work the same way – they have a back covered in microscopic suction cups which stick to
						smooth, flat surfaces. They stick very securely until you pull them off, and don't leave residue or affect your
						instrument's finish at all.</p>
					<p class="small-bottom-margin"><b>Note:</b> Before buying anything, ensure:</p>
					<ul class="small-bottom-margin">
						<li>Your instrument has a smooth, flat surface, like a pick guard or a glossy body. Most guitars/basses are good
							unless they have a bumpy or satin finish (exposed wood grain with no poly top-coat).</li>
						<li>There's enough space on your instrument. Put your phone flush against it - if at least ~60% of the phone's
							back is touching a smooth surface, then a case should work.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Otherwise, check out <a href="#other-methods" class="scrolly">Other Methods</a>.</p>

					<h3>Our Recommended Case</h3>

					<div class="product-box">
						<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2jNu2dE">
							<img class="product-image" border="0" src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01MCXLSUX&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=vulse-20">
						</a>
						<div class="details">
							<div class="product-name"><a href="http://amzn.to/2jNu2dE" target="_blank">Mega Tiny Corp MEGAVERSE Anti Gravity
									Case - with 4 Back Plates (Black, Silver, Gold, Rose Gold)</a></div>
							<div class="product-blurb">Large port holes mean any adapter will fit. Sturdy, beatiful backplates keep the
								suction surface clean. Better materials and quality control. Best warranty.</div>

							<a href="http://amzn.to/2jNu2dE" target="_blank" class="button special"><span class="product-price" product-id="B01MCXLSUX">Buy</span>
								on Amazon</a>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>Every micro-suction case we've tried works about the same, but there are two common problems: the headphone /
						charging holes can be too small to fit most cables through, and the suction back often clogs up with lint over
						time. The MEGAVERSE case is the only case that solves both of these problems, by having large port holes and
						(great-looking) removable backplates to keep the back clean while it's not sticking to something.</p>

					<p>Thanks to the great backplates, the MEGAVERSE case is really the only micro-suction case that is suitable to
						keep your phone in 24/7. That's what I do, and it's great for a lot of things: taking group photos, watching
						movies on airplanes, and of course, being ready to use Vulse without needing to switch cases.</p>

					<p>(There's also a version of this with useful backplates like a wallet, mirror, and bottle opener. It'll work
						exactly the same for Vulse, but get it if you're interested in the extra utility: <a href="http://amzn.to/2xHi3Db"
						 target="_blank"><span class="product-price" product-id="B01M9EYVA2">Buy</span> on Amazon</a>.)</p>

					<h3>How To Use Your Case</h3>

					<p>Whether you're using the MEGAVERSE case above, or one of the cheaper options below, attaching it will be the
						same. These directions are for a guitar, bass, or similar stringed instrument, but they should translate easily
						if you're using something else:
						<ol>
							<li><b>Choose a location</b><br />
								Ideally, you will have room for it below the strings, on the pickguard if you have one. As you can see from <a
								 href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjkjmTm0XD4" target="_blank">the demo video</a>, this spot is great for
								reaching it quickly while playing, and even synchronizing it with your strumming. The next best spot is between
								the bridge and the strap button – this is where Muse's guitarist famously mounts <a href="http://www.guitarworld.com/sites/default/files/public/styles/article_gallery_slider/public/muse%20guitar_5.jpg"
								 target="_blank">his effect controller</a>.</li>
							<li><b>Orient your phone</b><br />
								If your phone will be horizontal, face the bottom lightning port away from the guitar's neck. This may seem
								"upside-down" with Vulse open, but it's to ensure you can read everything normally while playing. Similarly, if
								your phone will be vertical, it should be most readable with the bottom port facing up.</li>
							<li><b>Remove the case's backplate</b>, if attached, to expose the suction surface.</li>
							<li><b>Press your phone firmly</b> onto the guitar. Without letting go, give it a moderate tug to test the
								suction. It should feel secure. If it does, you can let go. If not, you may need to press harder, or <a href="https://megatinycorp.com/blogs/how-to/clean-an-anti-gravity-case"
								 target="_blank">clean the case</a> if it looks clogged with lint (this won't be a problem if the case is brand
								new).</li>
						</ol>
					</p>

					<h3>A Cheaper Case</h3>

					<p>If you're looking for a budget option, this CloudValley case is good for the price ($9.99 at the time of
						writing). The port holes are a good size, and it has a backplate, like the MegaVerse case, though it doesn't have
						the range of attractive color/texture options.</p>

					<div class="product-box">
						<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2qu99VF">
							<img class="product-image" border="0" src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01KV1DJ1O&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=vulse-20">
						</a>
						<div class="details">
							<div class="product-name"><a href="http://amzn.to/2qu99VF" target="_blank">CloudValley Anti-Gravity Phone Case</a></div>
							<div class="product-blurb">Best option out of the cheap cases we tested. Good port hole size with a black
								back-plate.</div>

							<a href="http://amzn.to/2xGUgTN" target="_blank" class="button special"><span class="product-price" product-id="B01KV1DJ1O">Buy</span>
								on Amazon</a>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h4>Other cases we tried:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2xGUgTN" target="_blank">Cloudgo Case</a>: Previous budget pick – good port holes, no
							back plate. Recent price hike, though, from <$10 to $20.</li> <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2tTFh4i" target="_blank">Goat
									Case</a>: Sticks fine but the port holes are too small. I had to cut away part of the bottom of mine to get my
								iRig to fit.</li>
						<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2x0irJv" target="_blank">Mansion Case</a>: Basically identical to the Cloudgo case,
							but currently costs a little bit more. Out of the two, just get whichever is cheapest currently.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 id="other-methods" class="scroll-fragment">Other Methods</h3>

					<p>If a micro-suction case won't work (your instrument has a coarse finish, or a pickguard with too many screws),
						we recommend:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A regular, smooth, inexpensive phone case like <a href="http://amzn.to/2fVB77m">this JETech case</a>. If you
							already have a case like this, it should work, just avoid soft materials like leather.</li>
						<li>A small micro-suction pad like the <a href="https://megatinycorp.com/products/anti-gravity-space" target="_blank">Anti-Gravity
								Space</a>, or a sheet like <a href="http://amzn.to/2t0qd84" target="_blank">this Sewell AirStick</a> which you
							can cut to shape, and stack if you need the extra thickness to clear the screws.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="product-box">
						<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2t0qd84">
							<img class="product-image" border="0" src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00ITX9OU2&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=vulse-20">
						</a>
						<div class="details">
							<div class="product-name"><a href="http://amzn.to/2t0qd84" target="_blank">Sewell AirStick Microsuction Tape</a></div>
							<div class="product-blurb">Cut it to size and stick the adhesive side to your phone case or instrument,
								depending on your desired result. Stack multiple pieces to raise the phone above screw heads. One sheet is
								enough to make 5-10 micro-suction cases.</div>

							<a href="http://amzn.to/2t0qd84" target="_blank" class="button special"><span class="product-price" product-id="B00ITX9OU2">Buy</span>
								on Amazon</a>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>To solve the coarse finish problem, use the adhesive side of the Anti-Gravity Space directly on your instrument
						– the phone will attach to the micro-suction side. Keep the backplate attached when not in use. Bear in mind that
						adhesive can be more difficult to remove than micro-suction (though I've never had any damage or residue), so you
						shouldn't plan to frequently remove the pad from your instrument.</p>

					<p>There are also many other options. When prototyping Vulse, we just used a few pieces of <a href="http://amzn.to/2s0QjDF"
						 target="_blank">Velcro tape</a>. You can also try a <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOSGC1" target="_blank">clamp
							mount like this</a>, but be prepared for a bit of wobbling. Or you can try putting your phone somewhere other
						than the instrument, like on your belt or <a href="http://amzn.to/2yaO6gb" target="_blank">in an armband</a>.</p>

					<p>And here are some options that look very promising but aren't released yet:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jamstack-the-world-s-first-attachable-guitar-amp-music#/" target="_blank">JamStack</a>: An
							all-in-one option that is a phone mount, a cable, and an amp for output! This one is expensive, but very
							exciting, and looks like a great solution.</li>
						<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1906609363/tenikle-the-third-hand-for-your-phone-and-camera"
							 target="_blank">Tenikle</a>: A flexible tripod with suction cups. This one could be good for instruments
							without a large flat surface.</li>
					</ul>
