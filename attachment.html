							<h2>Attachment Guide</h2>
							<p>How to attach your phone to your instrument</p>
						</header>
						<p id="cases">To take full advantage of Vulse's interactive features, you'll need a way to temporarily affix your device to your instrument. If it's a guitar, bass, or another instrument (keytar, anyone?) with enough flat space to adhere your phone, then it's as simple as getting one of the micro-suction cases below.
						<p>All micro-suction cases work the same way – they have a back covered in microscopic suction cups which stick to smooth, flat surfaces. They stick very securely until you pull them off, and don't leave residue or affect your instrument's finish at all.</p>
						<p><b>Note:</b> Before buying anything, ensure there's space on your instrument by putting your phone flush against it. If at least ~60% of the phone's back is touching a flat surface, then a case should work. Otherwise, (maybe the surface is curved or crowded by small screws), skip to the <a href="#other-methods">next section</a>.</p>

						<h3>Our Recommended Case</h3>
						
						<p>Every micro-suction case we've tried works about the same, but there are two common problems: the headphone / charging holes can be too small to fit most cables through, and the suction back often clogs up with lint over time. The MEGAVERSE case below is the only case that solves both of these problems, by having large port holes and (great-looking) removable backplates to keep the back clean while it's not sticking to something.</p>

						<div class="product-box">

								<img class="product-image" border="0" src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01MCXLSUX&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=vulse-20">
							</a>
							<div class="details">
								<div class="product-name"><a href="http://amzn.to/2jNu2dE" target="_blank">Mega Tiny Corp MEGAVERSE Anti Gravity Case - with 4 Back Plates (Black, Silver, Gold, Rose Gold)</a></div>
								<div class="product-blurb">Large port holes mean any adapter will fit. Sturdy, beatiful backplates keep the suction surface clean. Better materials and quality control. Best warranty.</div>
								
								<a href="http://amzn.to/2jNu2dE" target="_blank" class="button special"><span class="product-price" product-id="B01MCXLSUX">Buy</span> on Amazon</a>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>Thanks to the great backplates, the MEGAVERSE case is really the only micro-suction case that is suitable to keep your phone in 24/7. That's what I do, and it's great for a lot of things: taking group photos, watching movies on airplanes, and of course, being ready to use Vulse without needing to switch cases.</p>

						<p>(There's also a version of this with useful backplates like a wallet, mirror, and bottle opener. It'll work exactly the same for Vulse, but get it if you're interested in the extra utility: <a href="http://amzn.to/2xHi3Db" target="_blank"><span class="product-price" product-id="B01M9EYVA2">Buy</span> on Amazon</a>.)</p>

						<h3>Cheaper Option</h3>

						<p>With the MEGAVERSE's case recent price drop, it's the best value by far and we would recommend it over any alternative. But if you're set on a cheap option, this Cloudgo case is good for the price. The port holes are decently sized, but it doesn't come with backplates like the MEGAVERSE case, so save the plastic film that it comes with, so you can cover the back while you're not using it.</p>

						<div class="product-box">
							<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2xGUgTN">
								<img class="product-image" border="0" src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01GK4U8EW&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=vulse-20">
							</a>
							<div class="details">
								<div class="product-name"><a href="http://amzn.to/2xGUgTN" target="_blank">Cloudgo Anti-Gravity Phone Case</a></div>
								<div class="product-blurb">Best option out of the cheap cases we tested. Decent port hole size. No backplates so save the plastic film.</div>
								
								<a href="http://amzn.to/2xGUgTN" target="_blank" class="button special"><span class="product-price" product-id="B01GK4U8EW">Buy</span> on Amazon</a>
							</div>
						</div>

						<h4>Other cases we tried:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2tTFh4i" target="_blank">Goat Case</a>: Sticks fine but the port holes are too small. I had to cut away part of the bottom of mine to get my iRig to fit.</li>
							<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2x0irJv" target="_blank">Mansion Case</a>: Basically identical to the Cloudgo case, but currently costs a little bit more. Out of the two, just get whichever is cheapest currently.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 id="other-methods" class="scroll-fragment">Other Methods</h3>

						<p>A common problem is that a guitar / bass will have a pickguard with many small screws that keep a phone case from sitting flush against it. In this case, we recommend:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>A regular, smooth, inexpensive phone case like <a href="http://amzn.to/2fVB77m">this JETech case</a>. If you already have a case like this, it should work, just avoid soft materials like leather.</li>
							<li>A small micro-suction pad like the <a href="https://megatinycorp.com/products/anti-gravity-space" target="_blank">Anti-Gravity Space</a>, or a sheet like <a href="http://amzn.to/2t0qd84" target="_blank">this Sewell AirStick</a> which you can cut to shape, and stack if you need the extra thickness to clear the screws.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="product-box">
							<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2t0qd84">
								<img class="product-image" border="0" src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00ITX9OU2&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=vulse-20">
							</a>
							<div class="details">
								<div class="product-name"><a href="http://amzn.to/2t0qd84" target="_blank">Sewell AirStick Microsuction Tape</a></div>
								<div class="product-blurb">Cut it to size and stick the adhesive side to your phone case (or to your instrument – this is more convenient if you're ok with leaving the pad on your instrument). Stack multiple pieces to raise the phone above screw heads. One sheet is enough to make 5-10 micro-suction cases.</div>
								
								<a href="http://amzn.to/2t0qd84" target="_blank" class="button special"><span class="product-price" product-id="B00ITX9OU2">Buy</span> on Amazon</a>
							</div>
						</div>


						<p>There are also many other options. When prototyping Vulse, we just used a few pieces of <a href="http://amzn.to/2s0QjDF" target="_blank">Velcro tape</a>. We'll also be testing out this <a href="http://amzn.to/2fvCwkz" target="_blank">gooseneck clamp mount</a> soon to see if it's a viable option. Or you can try putting your phone somewhere other than the instrument, like on your belt or <a href="http://amzn.to/2yaO6gb" target="_blank">in an armband</a>.</p>

						<p>And here are some options that look very promising but aren't released yet:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jamstack-the-world-s-first-attachable-guitar-amp-music#/" target="_blank">JamStack</a>: An all-in-one option that is a phone mount, a cable, and an amp for output!</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1906609363/tenikle-the-third-hand-for-your-phone-and-camera" target="_blank">Tenikle</a>: A flexible tripod with suction cups. This one could be good for instruments without a large flat surface.</li>
						</ul>
